> A PyTorch Lightning implementation of the HiFiGAN and iSTFT-Net vocoders

This library is for training [HiFiGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646) and [iSTFT-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02395) vocoders for speech synthesis. This implementation is one part of the [Speech Generation for Indigenous Language Education (SGILE)](#background) Project.

This repo has been separated in case you would like to use it separately from the broader SGILE system, but if you are looking to build speech synthesis systems from scratch, please visit [the main repository](https://github.com/EveryVoiceTTS/EveryVoice)

## Background

There are approximately 70 Indigenous languages spoken in Canada from 10 distinct language families.  As a consequence of the residential school system and other policies of cultural suppression, the majority of these languages now have fewer than 500 fluent speakers remaining, most of them elderly.

Despite this, Indigenous people have resisted colonial policies and continued speaking their languages, with interest by students and parents in Indigenous language education continuing to grow. Teachers are often overwhelmed by the number of students, and the trend towards online education means many students who have not previously had access to language classes now do. Supporting these growing cohorts of students comes with unique challenges in languages with few fluent first-language speakers. Teachers are particularly concerned with providing their students with opportunities to hear the language outside of class.

While there is no replacement for a speaker of an Indigenous language, there are possible applications for speech synthesis (text-to-speech) to supplement existing text-based tools like verb conjugators, dictionaries and phrasebooks.

The National Research Council has partnered with the Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa Kanyen‚Äôk√©ha immersion school, WÃ±S√ÅNEƒÜ School Board, University nuhelot‚ÄôƒØne thaiyots‚ÄôƒØ nistameyim√¢kanak Blue Quills, and the University of Edinburgh to research and develop state-of-the-art speech synthesis (text-to-speech) systems and techniques for Indigenous languages in Canada, with a focus on how to integrate text-to-speech technology into the classroom.

## Installation

Clone clone the repo and pip install it locally:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/EveryVoiceTTS/HiFiGAN_iSTFT_lightning.git
$ cd HiFiGAN_iSTFT_lightning
$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Configuration

You can change the base configuration in `hfgl/config/base.yaml`.

You can also create a new config.yaml file and add it to the `CONFIGS` object in `hfgl/config/__init__.py` and then use that key.

For example if you created a new config file at `myconfig.yaml` then you would update the `CONFIGS` object like so:

```python
CONFIGS: Dict[str, Path] = {
    "base": Path(__file__).parent / "base.yaml",
    "myconfig": Path(__file__).parent / "myconfig.yaml",
}
```

You can then use the `myconfig` config with any of the following commands like `hfgl train myconfig` or `hfgl preprocess myconfig -d mel -d audio` etc...

### Preprocessing

Preprocess by running: `hfgl preprocess base -d mel -d audio` to generate the Mel spectrograms and audio required for the model using the base configuration.

### Training

Train by running `hfgl train base` to use the base configuration.

You can pass updates to the configuration through the command line like so:

`hfgl train base --config preprocessing.save_dir=/my/new/path --config training.batch_size=16`
